## Introduction

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game . It allows players to compete against a computer opponent and enjoy a classic game of XOXO.

### The Story Behind XOXO Game

Once upon a time in Hyderabad, India, there lived a passionate young developer named Shreya Malogi. Shreya had always been fascinated by the world of games and wanted to create something simple yet enjoyable for people of all ages. That's when the idea for the XOXO Game was born.

### The Birth of XOXO

Shreya knew that Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as XOXO, was a timeless classic loved by many. But there was a challenge - Shreya wanted to create a unique digital version of this game that would be both fun and engaging. The goal was to make a game that could be enjoyed on various devices and would bring joy to players. XOXO Game became more than just a digital game; it became a source of entertainment during mundane lectures. Whenever students found themselves bored with long and dreary classes, they would sneakily open their devices and challenge their classmates to a quick game of XOXO. Laughter would ensue, and the once boring lectures became a bit more bearable.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Game Logic**: Implementing the game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe was the first challenge. Ensuring that players could only make valid moves and determining a win or a tie was a crucial task.

2. **AI Opponent**: Creating a computer opponent that could play against the user and provide a challenge was a complex problem. It involved implementing an AI algorithm to make strategic moves.

3. **Testing**: Rigorous testing was needed to ensure the game functioned correctly and didn't have any bugs or glitches.

### Overcoming Challenges

- **Game Logic**: Shreya spent time researching and studying the game's logic. By breaking down the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe into a step-by-step process, Shreya was able to implement the game's core functionality effectively.

- **AI Opponent**: To create a challenging AI opponent, Shreya implemented the minimax algorithm. This algorithm allowed the computer player to make intelligent moves, making the game more exciting for players.

- **Testing**: Shreya conducted thorough testing of the game, playing countless rounds to identify and fix any issues. Feedback from friends and testers helped in refining the game.
